# Data Source: intersight_fabric._fc_uplink_role
Configuration object sent by user to create a fc uplink port.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `admin_speed`:(string) Admin configured speed for the port.* `Auto` - Admin configurable speed AUTO ( default ).* `8Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 8Gbps.* `16Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 16Gbps.* `32Gbps` - Admin configurable speed 32Gbps. 
* `aggregate_port_id`:(int) Breakout port Identifier of the Switch Interface.When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the aggregatePortId is set to 0, and unused.When a port is configured as a breakout port, the 'aggregatePortId' port number as labeled on the equipment,e.g. the id of the port on the switch. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
* `fill_pattern`:(string) Fill pattern to differentiate the configs in NPIV.* `Idle` - Fc Fill Pattern type Idle.* `Arbff` - Fc Fill Pattern type Arbff. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `port_id`:(int) Port Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface.When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the portId is the port number as labeled on the equipment,e.g. the id of the port on the switch, FEX or chassis.When a port is configured as a breakout port, the 'portId' represents the port id on the fanout side of the breakout cable. 
* `slot_id`:(int) Slot Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface. 
* `vsan_id`:(int) Virtual San Identifier associated to the FC port.
