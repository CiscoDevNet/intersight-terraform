# Data Source: intersight_hyperflex_hxap_cluster
A HyperFlex Application Platform compute cluster. Contains inventory information concerning the health, version and ip address of the cluster. The cluster has a name assigned by user in Intersight.
## Argument Reference
The results of this data source are stored in `results` property.
All objects matching the filter criteria are fetched through pagination.
To access the ith object of the results obtained, use `data.intersight_hyperflex_hxap_cluster.results[i].<propertyname>`.
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `account_moid`:(string) The Account ID for this managed object. 
* `create_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was created. 
* `datacenter_name`:(string) Datacenter to which the cluster belongs. 
* `domain_group_moid`:(string) The DomainGroup ID for this managed object. 
* `failure_reason`:(string) Reason of the failure when cluster is in failed state. 
* `hypervisor_type`:(string) Identifies the broad type of the underlying hypervisor.* `ESXi` - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is a Vmware ESXi hypervisor of any version.* `HyperFlexAp` - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is Cisco HyperFlex Application Platform.* `Hyper-V` - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is Microsoft Hyper-V.* `Unknown` - The hypervisor running on the HyperFlex cluster is not known. 
* `identity`:(string) The internally generated identity of this cluster. This entity is not manipulated by users. It aids in uniquely identifying the cluster object. In case of VMware, this is a MOR (managed object reference). 
* `management_ip_address`:(string) Management IP Address of the cluster. 
* `mod_time`:(string) The time when this managed object was last modified. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) The user-provided name for this cluster to facilitate identification. 
* `shared_scope`:(string) Intersight provides pre-built workflows, tasks and policies to end users through global catalogs.Objects that are made available through global catalogs are said to have a 'shared' ownership. Shared objects are either made globally available to all end users or restricted to end users based on their license entitlement. Users can use this property to differentiate the scope (global or a specific license tier) to which a shared MO belongs. 
* `status`:(string) Cluster health status as reported by the hypervisor platform.* `Unknown` - Entity status is unknown.* `Degraded` - State is degraded, and might impact normal operation of the entity.* `Critical` - Entity is in a critical state, impacting operations.* `Ok` - Entity status is in a stable state, operating normally. 
* `total_cores`:(int) Total number of CPU cores in this cluster. It is a cumulative number across all hosts in the cluster. 
* `nr_version`:(string) Product version of HyperFlex compute cluster.
