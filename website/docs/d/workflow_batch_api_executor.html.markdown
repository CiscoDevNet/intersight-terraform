The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `description`:(string) A detailed description about the batch APIs. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name for the batch API task. 
* `retry_from_failed_api`:(bool) When an execution of a nth API in the Batch fails,Retry from falied API flag indicates if the execution should start from the nth API or the first API during task retry.By default the value is set to false. 
* `skip_on_condition`:(string) The skip expression, if provided, allows the batch API executor to skip thetask execution when the given expression evaluates to true.The expression is given as such a golang template that has to beevaluated to a final content true/false.
