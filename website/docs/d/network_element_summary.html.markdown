# Data Source: intersight_network._element_summary
View MO which aggregates information pertaining to a network element from mutiple MOs.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `admin_evac_state`:(string) Administratively configured state of Fabric Evacuation feature, for this switch. 
* `admin_inband_interface_state`:(string) The administrative state of the network Element inband management interface. 
* `available_memory`:(string) Available memory (un-used) on this switch platform. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
* `device_mo_id`:(string) The database identifier of the registered device of an object. 
* `dn`:(string) The Distinguished Name unambiguously identifies an object in the system. 
* `ethernet_mode`:(string) The user configured Ethernet operational mode for this switch (End-Host or Switching). 
* `ethernet_switching_mode`:(string) The user configured Ethernet operational mode for this switch (End-Host or Switching).* `end-host` - In end-host mode, the fabric interconnects appear to the upstream devices as end hosts with multiple links.In this mode, the switch does not run Spanning Tree Protocol and avoids loops by following a set of rules for traffic forwarding.In case of ethernet switching mode - Ethernet end-host mode is also known as Ethernet host virtualizer.* `switch` - In switch mode, the switch runs Spanning Tree Protocol to avoid loops, and broadcast and multicast packets are handled in the traditional way.This is the traditional switch mode. 
* `fault_summary`:(int) The fault summary of the network Element out-of-band management interface. 
* `fc_mode`:(string) The user configured FC operational mode for this switch (End-Host or Switching). 
* `fc_switching_mode`:(string) The user configured FC operational mode for this switch (End-Host or Switching).* `end-host` - In end-host mode, the fabric interconnects appear to the upstream devices as end hosts with multiple links.In this mode, the switch does not run Spanning Tree Protocol and avoids loops by following a set of rules for traffic forwarding.In case of ethernet switching mode - Ethernet end-host mode is also known as Ethernet host virtualizer.* `switch` - In switch mode, the switch runs Spanning Tree Protocol to avoid loops, and broadcast and multicast packets are handled in the traditional way.This is the traditional switch mode. 
* `firmware`:(string) Running firmware information. 
* `inband_ip_address`:(string) The IP address of the network Element inband management interface. 
* `inband_ip_gateway`:(string) The default gateway of the network Element inband management interface. 
* `inband_ip_mask`:(string) The network mask of the network Element inband management interface. 
* `inband_vlan`:(int) The VLAN ID of the network Element inband management interface. 
* `ipv4_address`:(string) IP version 4 address is saved in this property. 
* `management_mode`:(string) The management mode of the fabric interconnect.* `IntersightStandalone` - Intersight Standalone mode of operation.* `UCSM` - Unified Computing System Manager mode of operation.* `Intersight` - Intersight managed mode of operation. 
* `model`:(string) This field identifies the model of the given component. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the ElementSummary object is saved in this property. 
* `num_ether_ports`:(int) Total number of Ethernet ports. 
* `num_ether_ports_configured`:(int) Total number of configured Ethernet ports. 
* `num_ether_ports_link_up`:(int) Total number of Ethernet ports which are UP. 
* `num_expansion_modules`:(int) Total number of expansion modules. 
* `num_fc_ports`:(int) Total number of FC ports. 
* `num_fc_ports_configured`:(int) Total number of configured FC ports. 
* `num_fc_ports_link_up`:(int) Total number of FC ports which are UP. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `oper_evac_state`:(string) Operational state of the Fabric Evacuation feature, for this switch. 
* `operability`:(string) The switch's current overall operational/health state. 
* `out_of_band_ip_address`:(string) The IP address of the network Element out-of-band management interface. 
* `out_of_band_ip_gateway`:(string) The default gateway of the network Element out-of-band management interface. 
* `out_of_band_ip_mask`:(string) The network mask of the network Element out-of-band management interface. 
* `out_of_band_ipv4_address`:(string) The IPv4 address of the network Element out-of-band management interface. 
* `out_of_band_ipv4_gateway`:(string) The default IPv4 gateway of the network Element out-of-band management interface. 
* `out_of_band_ipv4_mask`:(string) The network mask of the network Element out-of-band management interface. 
* `out_of_band_ipv6_address`:(string) The IPv6 address of the network Element out-of-band management interface.
