# Data Source: intersight_asset_device_registration
DeviceRegistration represents a device connector enabled endpoint which has registered with Intersight.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `access_key_id`:(string) An identifier for the credential used by the device connector to authenticate with the Intersight web socket gateway. 
* `api_version`:(int) The version of the connector API, describes the capability of the connector's framework.If the version is lower than the current minimum supported version defined in the service managing the connection, the device connector will be connected with limited capabilities until the device connector is upgraded to a fully supported version. For example if a device connector that was released without delta inventory capabilities registers and connects to Intersight, inventory collection may be disabled until it has been upgraded. 
* `app_partition_number`:(int) The partition number corresponding to the instance of the Proxy App which is managing the web-socket to the device connector. 
* `claimed_by_user_name`:(string) The name of the user who claimed the device for the account. 
* `claimed_time`:(string) The date and time at which the device was claimed to this account. 
* `connection_id`:(string) The unique identifier for the current connection. The identifier persists across network connectivity loss and is reset on device connector process restart or platform administrator toggle of the Intersight connectivity. The connectionId can be used by services that need to interact with stateful plugins running in the device connector process. For example if a service schedules an inventory in a devices job scheduler plugin at registration it is not necessary to reschedule the job if the device loses network connectivity due to an Intersight service upgrade or intermittent network issues in the devices datacenter. 
* `connection_reason`:(string) If 'connectionStatus' is not equal to Connected, connectionReason provides further details about why the device is not connected with Intersight. 
* `connection_status`:(string) The status of the persistent connection between the device connector and Intersight.* `` - The target details have been persisted but Intersight has not yet attempted to connect to the target.* `Connected` - Intersight is able to establish a connection to the target and initiate management activities.* `NotConnected` - Intersight is unable to establish a connection to the target.* `ClaimInProgress` - Claim of the target is in progress. A connection to the target has not been fully established.* `Unclaimed` - The device was un-claimed from the users account by an Administrator of the device. Also indicates the failure to claim Custom Target details in Intersight.* `Claimed` - Custom Target is successfully claimed in Intersight. Currently no validation is performed to verify the Target connectivity from Intersight at the time of creation. However invoking API from Intersight Orchestrator fails if this Target is not reachable from Intersight or if Target credentials are incorrect. 
* `connection_status_last_change_time`:(string) The last time at which the 'connectionStatus' property value changed. If connectionStatus is Connected, this time can be interpreted as the starting time since which a persistent connection has been maintained between Intersight and Device Connector. If connectionStatus is NotConnected, this time can be interpreted as the last time the device connector was connected with Intersight. 
* `connector_version`:(string) The version of the device connector running on the managed device. 
* `device_external_ip_address`:(string) The IP Address of the managed device as seen from Intersight at the time of registration.This could be the IP address of the managed device's interface which has a route to the internet or a NAT IP addresss when the managed device is deployed in a private network. 
* `execution_mode`:(string) Indicates if the platform is an actual device or an emulated device for testing, demos, etc. Permitted values are [Normal, Emulator, ContainerEmulator].* `` - The device reported an empty or unrecognized executionMode.* `Normal` - The device connector is running in normal mode, i.e. it is not a simulation.* `Emulator` - The device connector is running in simulation mode inside an emulated device.* `ContainerEmulator` - The device connector is running in simulation mode inside a containerized emulated device. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `platform_type`:(string) The platform type on which device connector is executing.* `` - The device reported an empty or unrecognized platform type.* `APIC` - An Application Policy Infrastructure Controller cluster.* `DCNM` - A Data Center Network Manager instance. Data Center Network Manager (DCNM) is the network management platform for all NX-OS-enabled deployments, spanning new fabric architectures, IP Fabric for Media, and storage networking deployments for the Cisco Nexus-powered data center.* `UCSFI` - A UCS Fabric Interconnect in HA or standalone mode, which is being managed by UCS Manager (UCSM).* `UCSFIISM` - A UCS Fabric Interconnect in HA or standalone mode, managed directly by Intersight.* `IMC` - A standalone UCS Server Integrated Management Controller.* `IMCM4` - A standalone UCS M4 Server.* `IMCM5` - A standalone UCS M5 server.* `UCSIOM` - An UCS Chassis IO module.* `HX` - A HyperFlex storage controller.* `HyperFlexAP` - A HyperFlex Application Platform.* `UCSD` - A UCS Director virtual appliance. Cisco UCS Director automates, orchestrates, and manages Cisco and third-party hardware.* `IntersightAppliance` - A Cisco Intersight Connected Virtual Appliance.* `IntersightAssist` - A Cisco Intersight Assist.* `PureStorageFlashArray` - A Pure Storage FlashArray device.* `NetAppOntap` - A NetApp ONTAP storage system.* `NetAppActiveIqUnifiedManager` - A NetApp Active IQ Unified Manager.* `EmcScaleIo` - An EMC ScaleIO storage system.* `EmcVmax` - An EMC VMAX storage system.* `EmcVplex` - An EMC VPLEX storage system.* `EmcXtremIo` - An EMC XtremIO storage system.* `VmwareVcenter` - A VMware vCenter device that manages Virtual Machines.* `MicrosoftHyperV` - A Microsoft HyperV system that manages Virtual Machines.* `AppDynamics` - An AppDynamics controller that monitors applications.* `Dynatrace` - A Dynatrace controller that monitors applications.* `MicrosoftSqlServer` - A Microsoft SQL database server.* `Kubernetes` - A Kubernetes cluster that runs containerized applications.* `AmazonWebService` - A Amazon web service target that discovers and monitors different services like EC2. It discovers entities like VMs, Volumes, regions etc. and monitors attributes like Mem, CPU, cost.* `AmazonWebServiceBilling` - A Amazon web service billing target to retrieve billing information stored in S3 bucket.* `MicrosoftAzureServicePrincipal` - A Microsoft Azure Service Principal target that discovers all the associated Azure subscriptions.* `MicrosoftAzureEnterpriseAgreement` - A Microsoft Azure Enterprise Agreement target that discovers cost, billing and RIs.* `ServiceEngine` - Cisco Application Services Engine. Cisco Application Services Engine is a platform to deploy and manage applications.* `HitachiVirtualStoragePlatform` - A Hitachi Virtual Storage Platform also referred to as Hitachi VSP. It includes various storage systems designed for data centers.* `IMCBlade` - An Intersight managed UCS Blade Server.* `TerraformCloud` - A Terraform Cloud account.* `TerraformAgent` - A Terraform Cloud Agent that Intersight will deploy in datacenter.
