  Deployment inventory represents a Kubernetes Deployment. A Kubernetes Deployment provides declarative for Pods and ReplicaSets. For the Deployment in Intersight, it is an read only object that represent the Deployment. In Kubernetes world, you can describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. You can define Deployments to create new ReplicaSets, or to remove existing Deployments and adopt all their resources with new Deployments.
