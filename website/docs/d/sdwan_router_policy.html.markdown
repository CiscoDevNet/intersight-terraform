* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `deployment_size`:(string) Scale of the SD-WAN router virtual machine deployment.* `Typical` - Typical deployment configuration with 4 vCPUs and 4GB RAM.* `Minimal` - Minimal deployment configuration with 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `wan_count`:(int) Number of WAN connections across the SD-WAN site.
