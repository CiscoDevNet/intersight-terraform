description: |-
  A capabilityInfo is like a feature set and/or feature limit for different components of a HyperFlex Cluster. A set of constraints defines the rules, and the corresponding value either determines if the feature would work on a HyperFlex cluster with specific component set, or corresponds to a limit for a set of HyperFlex components. For example, minUcsVersion for HyperFlex version 4.0.1a corresponds to 3.2.3 or minHxdpVersion for HyperFlex Upgrade operation is 4.0.1a etc. This data can be captured as a capability and at run-time, decision can be made to proceed with the intended operation or not, or proceed with the intended operation with a value catered to specific feature sets.

# Data Source: intersight_hyperflex_capability_info
A capabilityInfo is like a feature set and/or feature limit for different components of a HyperFlex Cluster. A set of constraints defines the rules, and the corresponding value either determines if the feature would work on a HyperFlex cluster with specific component set, or corresponds to a limit for a set of HyperFlex components. For example, "minUcsVersion" for HyperFlex version "4.0.1a" corresponds to "3.2.3" or "minHxdpVersion" for HyperFlex Upgrade operation is "4.0.1a" etc. This data can be captured as a capability and at run-time, decision can be made to proceed with the intended operation or not, or proceed with the intended operation with a value catered to specific feature sets.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the capability or feature set consisting of a collection of constraint rules and value. 
* `value`:(string) Capability Value which is valid only iff all specified constraints match.
