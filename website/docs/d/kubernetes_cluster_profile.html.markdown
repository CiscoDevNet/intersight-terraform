* `description`:(string) Description of the profile. 
* `managed_mode`:(string) Management mode for the cluster. In some cases Intersight kubernetes service is not requiredto provision and manage the management entities and endpoints (for e.g. EKS). In most other casesit will be required to provision and manage these entities and endpoints.* `Provided` - Cluster management entities and endpoints are provided by the infrastructure platform.* `Managed` - Cluster management entities and endpoints are provisioned and managed by Intersight kubernetes service. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete profile. 
* `status`:(string) Status of the Kubernetes cluster and its nodes.* `Configuring` - The cluster is being configured.* `Deploying` - The cluster is being deployed.* `Undeploying` - The cluster is being undeployed.* `DeployFailed` - The cluster deployment failed.* `Upgrading` - The cluster is being upgraded.* `Deleting` - The cluster is being deleted.* `DeleteFailed` - The cluster delete failed.* `Ready` - The cluster is ready for use.* `Active` - The cluster is being active.* `Shutdown` - All the nodes in the cluster are powered off.* `Terminated` - The cluster is terminated.* `Deployed` - The cluster is deployed. The cluster may not yet be ready for use.* `UndeployFailed` - The cluster undeploy action failed.* `NotReady` - The cluster is created and some nodes are not ready. 
* `type`:(string) Defines the type of the profile. Accepted value is instance.* `instance` - The profile defines the configuration for a specific instance of a target.
