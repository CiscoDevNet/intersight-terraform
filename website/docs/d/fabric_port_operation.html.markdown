# Data Source: intersight_fabric._port_operation
PortOperation objects allows the user to alter the state of the port.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `admin_state`:(string) Admin configured state to disable the port.* `Enabled` - Admin configured Enabled State.* `Disabled` - Admin configured Disabled State. 
* `aggregate_port_id`:(int) Breakout port Identifier of the Switch Interface.When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the aggregatePortId is set to 0, and unused.When a port is configured as a breakout port, the 'aggregatePortId' port number as labeled on the equipment,e.g. the id of the port on the switch. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `port_id`:(int) Port Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface.When a port is not configured as a breakout port, the portId is the port number as labeled on the equipment,e.g. the id of the port on the switch, FEX or chassis.When a port is configured as a breakout port, the 'portId' represents the port id on the fanout side of the breakout cable. 
* `slot_id`:(int) Slot Identifier of the Switch/FEX/Chassis Interface.
