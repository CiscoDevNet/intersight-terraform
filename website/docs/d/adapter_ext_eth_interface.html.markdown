# Data Source: intersight_adapter._ext_eth_interface
Physical port of a virtual interface card.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `admin_state`:(string) Admin configured state of an External Ethernet Interface. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `device_mo_id`:(string) The database identifier of the registered device of an object. 
* `dn`:(string) The Distinguished Name unambiguously identifies an object in the system. 
* `ep_dn`:(string) Endpoint Config DN of an External Ethernet Interface. 
* `ext_eth_interface_id`:(string) Unique Identifier for an External Ethernet Interface within the adapter object. 
* `interface_type`:(string) Type of an External Ethernet Interface. 
* `mac_address`:(string) MAC address of an External Ethernet Interface. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `oper_state`:(string) Operational state of an Interface. 
* `peer_aggr_port_id`:(int) Peer Aggregate Port Id attached to an External Ethernet Interface. 
* `peer_dn`:(string) DN of peer end-point attached to an External Ethernet Interface. 
* `peer_port_id`:(int) Peer Port Id attached to an External Ethernet Interface. 
* `peer_slot_id`:(int) Peer Slot Id attached to an External Ethernet Interface. 
* `rn`:(string) The Relative Name uniquely identifies an object within a given context. 
* `switch_id`:(string) SwitchId attached to an External Ethernet Interface.
