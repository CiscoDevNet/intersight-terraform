# Data Source: intersight_adapter._host_eth_interface
Physical / Virtual port of an adapter as seen by the host.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `admin_state`:(string) Admin state of the Host Ethernet Interface. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
* `device_mo_id`:(string) The database identifier of the registered device of an object. 
* `dn`:(string) The Distinguished Name unambiguously identifies an object in the system. 
* `ep_dn`:(string) The Endpoint Config Dn of the Host Ethernet Interface. 
* `host_eth_interface_id`:(int) Unique Identifier for an Host Ethernet Interface within the adapter object. 
* `interface_type`:(string) Type of External Ethernet Interface. 
* `mac_address`:(string) Mac address of the Host Ethernet Interface. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of Host Ethernet Interface. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `oper_state`:(string) Operational state of an Interface. 
* `operability`:(string) Operability status of Host Ethernet Channel Interface. 
* `original_mac_address`:(string) The factory default Mac address of the Host Ethernet Interface. 
* `pci_addr`:(string) The PCI address of the Host Ethernet Interface. 
* `peer_dn`:(string) The distinguished name of the peer endpoint connected to the Host Ethernet interface. 
* `rn`:(string) The Relative Name uniquely identifies an object within a given context. 
* `virtualization_preference`:(string) Virtualization Preference of the Host Ethernet Interface indicating if virtualization is enabled or not. 
* `vnic_dn`:(string) The Virtual Ethernet Interface DN connected to the Host Ethernet Interface.
