# Data Source: intersight_vnic._fc_if
Virtual Fibre Channel Interface.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the virtual fibre channel interface. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `order`:(int) The order in which the virtual interface is brought up. The order assigned to an interface should be unique for all the Ethernet and Fibre-Channel interfaces on each PCI link on a VIC adapter. The maximum value of PCI order is limited by the number of virtual interfaces (Ethernet and Fibre-Channel) on each PCI link on a VIC adapter. All VIC adapters have a single PCI link except VIC 1385 which has two. 
* `persistent_bindings`:(bool) Enables retention of LUN ID associations in memory until they are manually cleared. 
* `type`:(string) VHBA Type configuration for SAN Connectivity Policy. This configuration is supported only on Cisco VIC 14XX series and higher series of adapters.* `fc-initiator` - The default value set for vHBA Type Configuration. Fc-initiator specifies vHBA as a consumer of storage. Enables SCSI commands to transfer data and status information between host and target storage systems.* `fc-nvme-initiator` - Fc-nvme-initiator specifies vHBA as a consumer of storage. Enables NVMe-based message commands to transfer data and status information between host and target storage systems.* `fc-nvme-target` - Fc-nvme-target specifies vHBA as a provider of storage volumes to initiators. Enables NVMe-based message commands to transfer data and status information between host and target storage systems. Currently tech-preview, only enabled with an asynchronous driver.* `fc-target` - Fc-target specifies vHBA as a provider of storage volumes to initiators. Enables SCSI commands to transfer data and status information between host and target storage systems. fc-target is enabled only with an asynchronous driver. 
* `vif_id`:(int) This should be the same as the channel number of the vfc created on switch in order to set up the data path. The property is applicable only for FI attached servers where a vfc is created on the switch for every vHBA. 
* `wwpn`:(string) The WWPN address that is assigned to the vHBA based on the wwn pool that has been assigned to the SAN Connectivity Policy.
