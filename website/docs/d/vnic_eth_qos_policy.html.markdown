# Data Source: intersight_vnic._eth_qos_policy
An Ethernet Quality of Service (QoS) policy assigns a system class to the outgoing traffic for a vNIC. This system class determines the quality of service for the outgoing traffic. For certain adapters additional controls can be specified like burst and rate on the outgoing traffic.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `cos`:(int) Class of Service to be associated to the traffic on the virtual interface. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `mtu`:(int) The Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) or packet size that the virtual interface accepts. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `priority`:(string) The priortity matching the System QoS specified in the fabric profile.* `Best Effort` - QoS Priority for Best-effort traffic.* `FC` - QoS Priority for FC traffic.* `Platinum` - QoS Priority for Platinum traffic.* `Gold` - QoS Priority for Gold traffic.* `Silver` - QoS Priority for Silver traffic.* `Bronze` - QoS Priority for Bronze traffic. 
* `rate_limit`:(int) The value in Mbps (0-10G/40G/100G depending on Adapter Model) to use for limiting the data rate on the virtual interface. Setting this to zero will turn rate limiting off. 
* `trust_host_cos`:(bool) Enables usage of the Class of Service provided by the operating system.
