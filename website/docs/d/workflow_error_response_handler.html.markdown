Intersight allows generic API tasks to be created by taking the API request
body and a response parser specification in the form of content.Grammar object.
Error Response Handler allows to create a generic error response specification
which can be used by multiple Batch API. The parameters provided in the Error
Response Handler may be used to parse error responses from an API request, if

# Data Source: intersight_workflow._error_response_handler
Intersight allows generic API tasks to be created by taking the API request
body and a response parser specification in the form of content.Grammar object.
Error Response Handler allows to create a generic error response specification
which can be used by multiple Batch API. The parameters provided in the Error
Response Handler may be used to parse error responses from an API request, if
the response specification provided for the API request does not define
error parameters.
## Argument Reference
