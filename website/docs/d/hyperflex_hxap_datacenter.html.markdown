# Data Source: intersight_hyperflex._hxap_datacenter
A datacenter object in HyperFlex Application Platform. It is a pre-defined object created internally by the system which acts as a container (logically) for all other objects (Host, VirtualMachine, Volume etc).
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `identity`:(string) Internally generated identity of this datacenter. This entity is not manipulated by users. It aids in uniquely identifying the datacenter object. For VMware, this is a MOR (managed object reference). 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) User provided name for the datacenter. Usually, this name is subject to manipulations by user. It is not the identity of the datacenter. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.
