# Data Source: intersight_compute._blade_identity
Identity object that uniquely represents a blade server object under a DR.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `admin_action`:(string) Updated by UI/API to trigger specific chassis action type.* `None` - No operation value for maintenance actions on an equipment.* `Decommission` - Decommission the equipment and temporarily remove it from being managed by Intersight.* `Recommission` - Recommission the equipment.* `Reack` - Reacknowledge the equipment and discover it again.* `Remove` - Remove the equipment permanently from Intersight management. 
* `admin_action_state`:(string) The state of Maintenance Action performed. This will have three states. Applying - Action is in progress. Applied - Action is completed and applied. Failed - Action has failed.* `None` - Nil value when no action has been triggered by the user.* `Applied` - User configured settings are in applied state.* `Applying` - User settings are being applied on the target server.* `Failed` - User configured settings could not be applied. 
* `chassis_id`:(int) Chassis Identifier of a blade server. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
* `device_mo_id`:(string) FI Device registration Mo ID. 
* `identifier`:(int) Numeric Identifier assigned by the management system to the equipment. 
* `lifecycle`:(string) The equipment's lifecycle status.* `None` - Default state of an equipment. This should be an initial state when no state is defined for an equipment.* `Active` - Default Lifecycle State for a physical entity.* `Decommissioned` - Decommission Lifecycle state.* `DecommissionInProgress` - Decommission Inprogress Lifecycle state.* `RecommissionInProgress` - Recommission Inprogress Lifecycle state.* `OperationFailed` - Failed Operation Lifecycle state.* `ReackInProgress` - ReackInProgress Lifecycle state.* `RemoveInProgress` - RemoveInProgress Lifecycle state.* `Discovered` - Discovered Lifecycle state.* `DiscoveryInProgress` - DiscoveryInProgress Lifecycle state.* `DiscoveryFailed` - DiscoveryFailed Lifecycle state.* `FirmwareUpgradeInProgress` - Firmware upgrade is in progress on given physical entity. 
* `model`:(string) The vendor provided model name for the equipment. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `pending_discovery`:(string) Value to indicate if discovery needs to be triggered after some event (ex. device connector reconnect). 
* `serial`:(string) The serial number of the equipment. 
* `slot_id`:(int) Chassis slot number of a blade server. 
* `vendor`:(string) The manufacturer of the equipment.
