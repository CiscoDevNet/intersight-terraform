A PSIRT definition is evaluated against all managed object referenced using the included data sources. Only Cisco TAC and Intersight devops engineers have the ability to create PSIRT definitions in Intersight.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments can be used to get data of already created objects in Intersight appliance:
* `advisory_id`:(string) Cisco generated identifier for the published security advisory. 
* `base_score`:(float) CVSS version 3 base score for the security Advisory. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `date_published`:(string) Date when the security advisory was first published by Cisco. 
* `date_updated`:(string) Date when the security advisory was last updated by Cisco. 
* `description`:(string) Brief description of the advisory details. 
* `environmental_score`:(float) CVSS version 3 environmental score for the security Advisory.

* `name`:(string) A user defined name for the Intersight Advisory. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `recommendation`:(string) Recommended action to resolve the security advisory. 
* `state`:(string) Current state of the advisory.* `ready` - Advisory has been evaluated. The affected devices would be analyzed and corresponding advisory instances would be created.* `evaluating` - Advisory is currently under evaluation. The affected devices would be analyzed but no advisory instances wouldbe created. The results of the analysis would be made available to Intersight engineering for evaluation and validation. 
* `status`:(string) Cisco assigned status of the published advisory based on whether the investigation is complete or on-going.* `interim` - The Cisco investigation for the advisory is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.* `final` - Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.
