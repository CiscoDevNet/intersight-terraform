# Resource: intersight_sdwan_router_policy
A policy specifying SD-WAN router details.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `deployment_size`:(string) Scale of the SD-WAN router virtual machine deployment.* `Typical` - Typical deployment configuration with 4 vCPUs and 4GB RAM.* `Minimal` - Minimal deployment configuration with 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to sdwanProfile resources.

* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `wan_count`:(int) Number of WAN connections across the SD-WAN site. 
* `wan_termination_type`:(string) Defines if the WAN networks are singly or dually terminated. Dually terminated WANs are configured on all the SD-WAN routers. Singly terminated WANs are configured only on one of the SD-WAN routers.* `Single` - Singly terminated WANs ar evenly distributed across SD-WAN router nodes. A given WAN connection is available only on one of the router nodes.* `Dual` - Dually terminated WANs are configured on all the SD-WAN routers. A given WAN connection is available on multiple router nodes.
