# Resource: intersight_networkconfig_policy
Enable or disable Dynamic DNS, add or update DNS settings for IPv4 and IPv6 on Cisco IMC.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `alternate_ipv4dns_server`:(string) IP address of the secondary DNS server. 
* `alternate_ipv6dns_server`:(string) IP address of the secondary DNS server. 
* `appliance_account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `dynamic_dns_domain`:(string) The domain name appended to a hostname for a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) update. If left blank, only a hostname is sent to the DDNS update request. 
* `enable_dynamic_dns`:(bool) If enabled, updates the resource records to the DNS from Cisco IMC. 
* `enable_ipv4dns_from_dhcp`:(bool) If enabled, Cisco IMC retrieves the DNS server addresses from DHCP. Use DHCP field must be enabled for IPv4 in Cisco IMC to enable it. 
* `enable_ipv6`:(bool) If enabled, allows to configure IPv6 properties. 
* `enable_ipv6dns_from_dhcp`:(bool) If enabled, Cisco IMC retrieves the DNS server addresses from DHCP. Use DHCP field must be enabled for IPv6 in Cisco IMC to enable it. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `preferred_ipv4dns_server`:(string) IP address of the primary DNS server. 
* `preferred_ipv6dns_server`:(string) IP address of the primary DNS server. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources.
