# Resource: intersight_config_importer
All import operations are captured as Importer instances. Users shall use this Importer mo to track the import operation progress.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `import_path`:(string) The path to the archive in Intersight storage that has all the MOsto be imported. 
* `import_source`:(string) The source of the archive in Intersight storage that has all the MOsto be imported.* `ImageRepo` - The 'ImageRepo' source if the source of exporter archive is image repository.* `URL` - The 'URL' source if the source of exported archive is a URL. 
* `imported_items`:(Array)(Computed) An array of relationships to configImportedItem resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) An identifier for the importer instance. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `skip_integrity_checks`:(bool) Specifies whether integrity checks must be skipped. 
* `status`:(string)(Computed) Status of the import operation.* `` - The operation has not started.* `InProgress` - The operation is in progress.* `Success` - The operation has succeeded.* `Failed` - The operation has failed.* `RollBackInitiated` - The rollback has been inititiated for import failure.* `RollBackFailed` - The rollback has failed for import failure.* `RollbackCompleted` - The rollback has completed for import failure.* `RollbackAborted` - The rollback has been aborted for import failure.* `OperationTimedOut` - The operation has timed out. 
* `status_message`:(string)(Computed) Status message associated with failures or progress indication. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 


## Import
`intersight_config_importer` can be imported using the Moid of the object, e.g.
