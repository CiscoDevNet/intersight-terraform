# Resource: intersight_vnic_lan_connectivity_policy
A LAN Connectivity Policy determines the network resources and the connections between the server and the LAN on the network. This policy uses Consistent Device Naming to configure the vNIC. You can configure a usNIC or VMQ connection for the vNIC to improve network performance.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `eth_ifs`:(Array) An array of relationships to vnicEthIf resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `iqn_allocation_type`:(string) Allocation Type of iSCSI Qualified Name - Static/Dynamic/None.* `None` - Type defines that property is not applicable for an interface.* `Auto` - The system selects an interface automatically - DHCP.* `Static` - Type represents that static information or properties are associated to an interface.* `Pool` - Type defines that property value will be fetched from an associated pool. 
* `iqn_pool`:(HashMap) - A reference to a iqnpoolPool resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `organization`:(HashMap) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource.

* `placement_mode`:(string) The mode used for placement of vNICs on network adapters. It can either be Auto or Custom.* `custom` - The placement of the vNICs / vHBAs on network adapters is manually chosen by the user.* `auto` - The placement of the vNICs / vHBAs on network adapters is automatically determined by the system. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship.

* `static_iqn_name`:(string) User provided static iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN) for use as initiator identifiers by iSCSI vNICs in a Fabric Interconnect domain. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `target_platform`:(string) The platform for which the server profile is applicable. It can either be a server that is operating in standalone mode or which is attached to a Fabric Interconnect managed by Intersight.* `Standalone` - Servers which are operating in standalone mode i.e. not connected to a Fabric Interconnected.* `FIAttached` - Servers which are connected to a Fabric Interconnect that is managed by Intersight. 

## Usage Example
### Resource Creation
```hcl
resource "intersight_vnic_lan_connectivity_policy" "vnic_lan1" {
  name = "vnic_lan1"
  organization {
    object_type = "organization.Organization"
    moid = var.organization
  }
  profiles {
    moid = intersight_server_profile.server1.id
    object_type = "server.Profile"
  }
}
```
