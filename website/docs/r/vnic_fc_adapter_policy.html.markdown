# Resource: intersight_vnic_fc_adapter_policy
A Fibre Channel Adapter policy governs the host-side behavior of the adapter, including how the adapter handles traffic. You can enable FCP Error Recovery, change the default settings of Queues and Interrupt handling for performance enhancement.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `error_detection_timeout`:(int) Error Detection Timeout, also referred to as EDTOV, is the number of milliseconds to wait before the system assumes that an error has occurred. 
* `error_recovery_settings`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - Fibre Channel Error Recovery Settings. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
  + `enabled`:(bool) Enables Fibre Channel Error recovery. 
  + `io_retry_count`:(int) The number of times an I/O request to a port is retried because the port is busy before the system decides the port is unavailable. 
  + `io_retry_timeout`:(int) The number of seconds the adapter waits before aborting the pending command and resending the same IO request. 
  + `link_down_timeout`:(int) The number of milliseconds the port should actually be down before it is marked down and fabric connectivity is lost. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
  + `port_down_timeout`:(int) The number of milliseconds a remote Fibre Channel port should be offline before informing the SCSI upper layer that the port is unavailable. For a server with a VIC adapter running ESXi, the recommended value is 10000. For a server with a port used to boot a Windows OS from the SAN, the recommended value is 5000 milliseconds. 
* `flogi_settings`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - Fibre Channel Flogi Settings.

  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
  + `retries`:(int) The number of times that the system tries to log in to the fabric after the first failure. 
  + `timeout`:(int) The number of milliseconds that the system waits before it tries to log in again.

  + `mode`:(string) The preferred driver interrupt mode. This can be one of the following:- MSIx - Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) with the optional extension. MSI  - MSI only. INTx - PCI INTx interrupts. MSIx is the recommended option.* `MSIx` - Message Signaled Interrupt (MSI) mechanism with the optional extension (MSIx). MSIx is the recommended and default option.* `MSI` - Message Signaled Interrupt (MSI) mechanism that treats messages as interrupts.* `INTx` - Line-based interrupt (INTx) mechanism similar to the one used in Legacy systems.

* `io_throttle_count`:(int) The maximum number of data or control I/O operations that can be pending for the virtual interface at one time. If this value is exceeded, the additional I/O operations wait in the queue until the number of pending I/O operations decreases and the additional operations can be processed. 
* `lun_count`:(int) The maximum number of LUNs that the Fibre Channel driver will export or show. The maximum number of LUNs is usually controlled by the operating system running on the server. 
* `lun_queue_depth`:(int) The number of commands that the HBA can send and receive in a single transmission per LUN.

If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'.
