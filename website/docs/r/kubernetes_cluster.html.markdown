# Resource: intersight_kubernetes_cluster
Inventories a Kubernetes cluster state. A Cluster object is automatically created when a Kubernetes API server is configured for a cluster.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
* `connection_status`:(string) Status of the endpoint connection of this Kubernetes cluster.* `` - The target details have been persisted but Intersight has not yet attempted to connect to the target.* `Connected` - Intersight is able to establish a connection to the target and initiate management activities.* `NotConnected` - Intersight is unable to establish a connection to the target.* `ClaimInProgress` - Claim of the target is in progress. A connection to the target has not been fully established.* `Unclaimed` - The device was un-claimed from the users account by an Administrator of the device. Also indicates the failure to claim Custom Target details in Intersight.* `Claimed` - Custom Target is successfully claimed in Intersight. Currently no validation is performed to verify the Target connectivity from Intersight at the time of creation. However invoking API from Intersight Orchestrator fails if this Target is not reachable from Intersight or if Target credentials are incorrect. 
* `kube_config`:(string) Kubeconfig for the cluster to collect inventory for. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the Kubernetes cluster. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `registered_devices`:(Array) An array of relationships to assetDeviceRegistration resources.

* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 


## Import
`intersight_kubernetes_cluster` can be imported using the Moid of the object, e.g.
