# Resource: intersight_virtualization_virtual_disk
Depicts disk configuration used to be create a virtual disk on a hypervisor datastore.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `capacity`:(string) Disk capacity to be provided with units example - 10Gi. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `cluster`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a virtualizationBaseCluster resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `discovered`:(bool)(Computed) Flag to indicate whether the configuration is created from inventory object. 
* `inventory`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) A reference to a virtualizationBaseVirtualDisk resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `mode`:(string) File mode of the disk  example - Filesystem, Block.* `Block` - It is a Block virtual disk.* `Filesystem` - It is a File system virtual disk. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the storage disk. Name must be unique within a Datastore. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `registered_device`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a assetDeviceRegistration resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
