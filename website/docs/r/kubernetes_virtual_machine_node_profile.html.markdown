# Resource: intersight_kubernetes_virtual_machine_node_profile
A profile specifying configuration settings for a Virtual Machine node. It is auto-generated based on the NodeGroupProfile and VirtualMachineNodePolicy configuration. Users can do operations like Drain, Cordon, Rebuild on a node.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `cloud_provider`:(string) Cloud provider for this node profile.* `noProvider` - Enables the use of no cloud provider.* `external` - Out of tree cloud provider, e.g. CPI for vsphere. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the profile. 
* `ip_addresses`:(Array) An array of relationships to ippoolIpLease resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete profile. 
* `node_group`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a kubernetesNodeGroupProfile resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
