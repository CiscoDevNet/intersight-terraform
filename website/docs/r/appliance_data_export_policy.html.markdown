  Data Export Policy is a category-based data collection policy that enables or disables
data export (data collection) from the Intersight Appliance to the Intersight. The Data
Export Policy configuration is organized hierarchically as follows.
  Global:
     Inventory:
        Network
        Storage
     TechSupport
When the DataExportPolicy for a category is enabled/disabled, all the sub-category configurations
are enabled/disabled as well. For example, if you enable/disable Inventory, all its sub-category
configurations (ie. Network and Storage) are also enabled/disabled.

Data Export Policy is a category-based data collection policy that enables or disables
data export (data collection) from the Intersight Appliance to the Intersight. The Data
Export Policy configuration is organized hierarchically as follows.
  Global:
     Inventory:
        Network

When the DataExportPolicy for a category is enabled/disabled, all the sub-category configurations
are enabled/disabled as well. For example, if you enable/disable Inventory, all its sub-category
configurations (ie. Network and Storage) are also enabled/disabled.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `enable`:(bool) Status of the data collection mode. If the value is 'true', then data collection is enabled. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string)(Computed) Name of the Data Export Policy. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `parent_config`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) A reference to a applianceDataExportPolicy resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `sub_configs`:(Array)(Computed) An array of relationships to applianceDataExportPolicy resources.

  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.

* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:

(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value.
