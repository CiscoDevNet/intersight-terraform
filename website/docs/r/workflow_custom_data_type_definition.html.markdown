# Resource: intersight_workflow._custom_data_type_definition
Captures a customized data type definition that can be used for task or workflow input/output. This can be reused across multiple tasks and workflow definitions.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `catalog`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a workflowCatalog resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `composite_type`:(bool) When true this data type definition is a collection of type definitions to represent composite data like JSON. 
* `description`:(string) A human-friendly description of this custom data type indicating it's domain and usage. 
* `label`:(string) A user friendly short name to identify the custom data type definition. Label can only contain letters (a-z, A-Z), numbers (0-9), hyphen (-), period (.), colon (:), space ( ), single quote ('), or an underscore (_). 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) The name of custom data type definition. The valid name can contain lower case and upper case alphabetic characters, digits and special characters '-' and '_'. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `parameter_set`:(Array)

  + `condition`:(string) The condition to be evaluated.* `eq` - Checks if the values of the two parameters are equal.* `ne` - Checks if the values of the two parameters are not equal.* `contains` - Checks if the second parameter string value is a substring of the first parameter string value.* `matchesPattern` - Checks if a string matches a regular expression. 
  + `control_parameter`:(string) Name of the controlling entity, whose value will be used for evaluating the parameter set. 
  + `enable_parameters`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
  + `name`:(string) Name for the parameter set.  Limited to 64 alphanumeric characters (upper and lower case), and special characters '-' and '_'. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `value`:(string) The controlling parameter will be evaluated against this 'value'. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `type_definition`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
  + `default`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - Default value for the data type. If default value was provided and the input was required the default value will be used as the input. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
    + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
    + `override`:(bool) Override the default value provided for the data type. When true, allow the user to enter value for the data type. 
    + `value`: Default value for the data type. If default value was provided and the input was required the default value will be used as the input. 
  + `description`:(string) Provide a detailed description of the data type.

The format to specify mapping when the source property is of object reference and mapping needs to be made to the property of the object is '${workflow.input.property.subproperty}'. The format to specify mapping in a custom data type definition is '${datatype.type.property}'. When the current property is of non-scalar type like composite custom data type, then mapping can be provided to the individual property of the custom data type like 'cdt_property:${workflow.input.property}'.
