# Resource: intersight_fabric_system_qos_policy
Configuration object sent by user to setup Quality of Service (QoS) for this switch.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
* `classes`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `admin_state`:(string) Administrative state for this QoS class.* `Disabled` - Admin configured Disabled State.* `Enabled` - Admin configured Enabled State. 
  + `bandwidth_percent`:(int) Percentage of bandwidth received by the traffic tagged with this QoS. 
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
  + `cos`:(int) Class of service received by the traffic tagged with this QoS. 
  + `mtu`:(int) Maximum transmission unit (MTU) is the largest size packet or frame,that can be sent in a packet- or frame-based network such as the Internet.User can select from the following:1. Any value between 1500 and 92162. 'Normal' (default) mapping to a value of 1500.3. 'FC' mapping to a value of 2240. 
  + `multicast_optimize`:(bool) If enabled, this QoS class will be optimized to send multiple packets. 
  + `name`:(string) The 'name' of this QoS Class.* `Best Effort` - QoS Priority for Best-effort traffic.* `FC` - QoS Priority for FC traffic.* `Platinum` - QoS Priority for Platinum traffic.* `Gold` - QoS Priority for Gold traffic.* `Silver` - QoS Priority for Silver traffic.* `Bronze` - QoS Priority for Bronze traffic. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
  + `packet_drop`:(bool) If enabled, this QoS class will allow packet drops within an acceptable limit. 
  + `weight`:(int) The weight of the QoS Class controls the distribution of bandwidth between QoS Classes,with the same priority after the Guarantees for the QoS Classes are reached. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to fabricSwitchProfile resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value.
