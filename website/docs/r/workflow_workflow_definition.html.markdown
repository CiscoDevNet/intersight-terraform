# Resource: intersight_workflow_workflow_definition
Workflow definition is a collection of tasks that are sequenced in a certain way using control tasks. The tasks in the workflow definition is represented as a directed acyclic graph where each node in the graph is a task and the edges in the graph are transitions from one task to another.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `catalog`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a workflowCatalog resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `default_version`:(bool) When true this will be the workflow version that is used when a specific workflow definition version is not specified. The default version is used when user executes a workflow without specifying a version or when workflow is included in another workflow without a specific version. The very first workflow definition created with a name will be set as the default version, after that user can explicitly set any version of the workflow definition as the default version. 
* `description`:(string) The description for this workflow.
