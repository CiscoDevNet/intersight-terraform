# Resource: intersight_vnic_san_connectivity_policy
SAN connectivity policy determines the network storage resources and the connections between the server and the SAN on the network. This policy enables configuration of vHBAs that the servers use to communicate with the storage network.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `fc_ifs`:(Array) An array of relationships to vnicFcIf resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `organization`:(HashMap) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `placement_mode`:(string) The mode used for placement of vNICs on network adapters. It can either be Auto or Custom.* `custom` - The placement of the vNICs / vHBAs on network adapters is manually chosen by the user.* `auto` - The placement of the vNICs / vHBAs on network adapters is automatically determined by the system. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1.

* `static_wwnn_address`:(string) The WWNN address for the server node must be in hexadecimal format xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx.Allowed ranges are 20:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 to 20:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF or from 50:00:00:00:00:00:00:00 to 5F:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.To ensure uniqueness of WWN's in the SAN fabric, you are strongly encouraged to use the WWN prefix - 20:00:00:25:B5:xx:xx:xx. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `target_platform`:(string) The platform for which the server profile is applicable. It can either be a server that is operating in standalone mode or which is attached to a Fabric Interconnect managed by Intersight.* `Standalone` - Servers which are operating in standalone mode i.e. not connected to a Fabric Interconnected.* `FIAttached` - Servers which are connected to a Fabric Interconnect that is managed by Intersight. 
* `wwnn_address_type`:(string) Type of allocation selected to assign a WWNN address for the server node.* `POOL` - The user selects a pool from which the mac/wwn address will be leased for the Virtual Interface.* `STATIC` - The user assigns a static mac/wwn address for the Virtual Interface. 
* `wwnn_pool`:(HashMap) - A reference to a fcpoolPool resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship.
