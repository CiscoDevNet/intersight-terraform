# Resource: intersight_smtp_policy
Name that identifies the SMTP Policy.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `enabled`:(bool) If enabled, controls the state of the SMTP client service on the managed device. 
* `min_severity`:(string) Minimum fault severity level to receive email notifications. Email notifications are sent for all faults whose severity is equal to or greater than the chosen level.* `critical` - Minimum severity to report is critical.* `condition` - Minimum severity to report is informational.* `warning` - Minimum severity to report is warning.* `minor` - Minimum severity to report is minor.* `major` - Minimum severity to report is major. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources.

* `sender_email`:(string) The email address entered here will be displayed as the from address (mail received from address) of all the SMTP mail alerts that are received. If not configured, the hostname of the server is used in the from address field. 
* `smtp_port`:(int) Port number used by the SMTP server for outgoing SMTP communication. 
* `smtp_recipients`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
* `smtp_server`:(string) IP address or hostname of the SMTP server. The SMTP server is used by the managed device to send email notifications.
