# Resource: intersight_ipmioverlan_policy
Intelligent Platform Management Interface Over LAN Policy.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `enabled`:(bool) State of the IPMI Over LAN service on the endpoint. 
* `encryption_key`:(string) The encryption key to use for IPMI communication. It should have an even number of hexadecimal characters and not exceed 40 characters. 
* `is_encryption_key_set`:(bool)(Computed) Indicates whether the value of the 'encryptionKey' property has been set. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `privilege`:(string) The highest privilege level that can be assigned to an IPMI session on a server.* `admin` - Privilege to perform all actions available through IPMI.* `user` - Privilege to perform some functions through IPMI but restriction on performing administrative tasks.* `read-only` - Privilege to view information throught IPMI but restriction on making any changes. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources.
