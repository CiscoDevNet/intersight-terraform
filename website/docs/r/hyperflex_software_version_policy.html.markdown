# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_software_version_policy
A policy capturing software versions for different HyperFlex Cluster compatible components ( like HyperFlex Data Platform, Hypervisor, etc. ), that the user wishes to apply on the HyperFlex cluster.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `cluster_profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to hyperflexClusterProfile resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `hxdp_version`:(string) Desired HyperFlex Data Platform software version to apply on the HyperFlex cluster. 
* `hxdp_version_info`:(HashMap) -(Computed) A reference to a softwareHyperflexDistributable resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.
