# Resource: intersight_softwarerepository._category_mapper
Maps a Cisco software repository image category identifier to its applicable hardware models.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `category`:(string) The category of the model series. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
* `file_type`:(string) The type of distributable image, example huu, scu, driver, os.* `Distributable` - Stores firmware host utility images and fabric images.* `DriverDistributable` - Stores driver distributable images.* `ServerConfigurationUtilityDistributable` - Stores server configuration utility images.* `OperatingSystemFile` - Stores operating system iso images.* `HyperflexDistributable` - It stores HyperFlex images. 
* `mdf_id`:(string) Cisco software repository image category identifier. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) An unique identifer for a capability descriptor. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `regex_pattern`:(string) The regex that all images of this category follow. 
* `section`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a capabilitySection resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `source`:(string) The image can be downloaded from cisco.com or external cloud store.* `Cisco` - External repository hosted on cisco.com.* `IntersightCloud` - Repository hosted by the Intersight Cloud.* `LocalMachine` - The file is available on the local client machine. Used as an upload source type.* `NetworkShare` - External repository in the customer datacenter. This will typically be a file server. 
* `supported_models`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
* `sw_id`:(string) The software type id provided by cisco.com. 
* `tag_types`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `version`:(string) The version from which user can download images from amazon store, if source is external cloud store.
