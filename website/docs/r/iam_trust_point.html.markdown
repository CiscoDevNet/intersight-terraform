# Resource: intersight_iam_trust_point
To affirm the identity of trusted source.
Allows import of third-party CA certificates in X.509 (CER) format.
It can be a root CA or an trust chain that leads to a root CA.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `certificates`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
  + `issuer`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) The X.509 distinguished name of the issuer of this certificate. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
    + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
    + `common_name`:(string)(Computed) A required component that identifies a person or an object. 
    + `country`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `locality`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
    + `organization`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `organizational_unit`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
    + `state`:
                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `pem_certificate`:(string) The base64 encoded certificate in PEM format. 
  + `sha256_fingerprint`:(string)(Computed) The computed SHA-256 fingerprint of the certificate. Equivalent to 'openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha256'. 
  + `signature_algorithm`:(string)(Computed) Signature algorithm, as specified in [RFC 5280](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280). 
  + `subject`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) The X.509 distinguished name of the subject of this certificate. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
    + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
    + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
    + `common_name`:(string)(Computed) A required component that identifies a person or an object.

                (Array of schema.TypeString) -
* `chain`:(string) The certificate information for this trusted point. The certificate must be in Base64 encoded X.509 (CER) format. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.
