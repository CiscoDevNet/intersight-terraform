# Resource: intersight_iam._certificate_request
The information required to generate a certificate signing request (CSR),
which is a block of encoded text that is given to a Certificate Authority when applying for an SSL Certificate.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `certificate`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a iamCertificate resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource.

* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `email_address`:(string) User input email address, an optional part of the subject of the certificate request. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the certificate request. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `private_key_spec`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a iamPrivateKeySpec resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `request`:(string)(Computed) Generated certificate signing request (CSR) in PEM format. 
* `self_signed`:(bool) Whether the user wants the generated CSR to be self-signed by the appliance. 
* `subject`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - The x.509 distinguished name of the subject of the certificate request.
