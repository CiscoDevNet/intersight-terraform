# Resource: intersight_resource_group
A group of REST resources, such as a group of compute.Blade MOs. A ResourceGroup can contain static members which are specified as a set of object references, or it can contain dynamic members, which are specified through OData query filters. A Resource can be part of multiple resource groups.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `account`:(HashMap) -(Computed) A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) The name of this resource group. 
* `organizations`:(Array) An array of relationships to organizationOrganization resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1.

* `per_type_combined_selector`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `combined_selector`:(string)(Computed) A single filter expression created by OR'ing the $filter criteria of the 'selectors'. Used to efficiently maintain the membership of the Group. 
  + `empty_filter`:(bool)(Computed) If true, then resources are added using just object type without filter. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `selector_object_type`:(string)(Computed) The ObjectType on which the selectors are defined. Used to efficiently query resource groups for a given ObjectType. 
* `qualifier`:(string) Qualifier shall be used to specify if we want to organize resources using multiple resource group or single For an account, resource groups can be of only one of the above types. (Both the types are mutually exclusive for an account.).* `Allow-Selectors` - Resources will be added to resource groups based on ODATA filter. Multiple resource group can be created to organize resources.* `Allow-All` - All resources will become part of the Resource Group. Only one resource group can be created to organize resources. 
* `selectors`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `selector`:(string) ODATA filter to select resources. The group selector may include URLs of individual resource, or OData query with filters that match multiple queries. The URLs must be relative (i.e. do not include the host). 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value.
