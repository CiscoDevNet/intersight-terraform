# Resource: intersight_kvm_session
Virtual KVM Session that provides Single Sign-On access to the vKVM console of the server. The vKVM access can be direct or can be tunneled by specifying the tunnel to be used for the access.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `device`:(HashMap) -(Computed) A reference to a assetDeviceRegistration resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `one_time_password`:(string) Temporary one-time password for KVM access. 
* `server`:(HashMap) - A reference to a computePhysical resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource.

* `sso_supported`:(bool)(Computed) Indicates if KVM SSO is supported on the server. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `tunnel`:(HashMap) - A reference to a kvmTunnel resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship.

* `username`:(string) Username used for KVM access.
