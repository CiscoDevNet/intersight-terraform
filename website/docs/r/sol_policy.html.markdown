# Resource: intersight_sol_policy
Policy for configuring Serial Over LAN settings on endpoint.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `baud_rate`:(int) Baud Rate used for Serial Over LAN communication.* `9600` - Use baud rate 9600 for communication.* `19200` - Use baud rate 19200 for communication.* `38400` - Use baud rate 38400 for communication.* `57600` - Use baud rate 57600 for communication.* `115200` - Use baud rate 115200 for communication. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
* `com_port`:(string) Serial port through which the system routes Serial Over LAN communication. This field is available only on some Cisco UCS C-Series servers. If it is unavailable, the server uses COM port 0 by default.* `com0` - Use serial port com0 for communication.* `com1` - Use serial port com1 for communication. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `enabled`:(bool) State of Serial Over LAN service on the endpoint. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to policyAbstractConfigProfile resources.

* `ssh_port`:(int) SSH port used to access Serial Over LAN directly. Enables bypassing Cisco IMC shell to provide direct access to Serial Over LAN. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 


## Import
`intersight_sol_policy` can be imported using the Moid of the object, e.g.
