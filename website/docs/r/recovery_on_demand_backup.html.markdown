# Resource: intersight_recovery_on_demand_backup
Handles requests for on demand backup for a given endpoint.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
* `config_result`:(Array with Maximum of one item) -(Computed) A reference to a recoveryConfigResult resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `device_id`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a assetDeviceRegistration resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `file_name_prefix`:(string) The file name for the backup image. This name is added as a prefix in the name for the backup image. A unique file name for the backup image is created along with a timestamp. For example: prefix-1572431305418. 
* `is_password_set`:(bool)(Computed) Indicates whether the value of the 'password' property has been set. 
* `location_type`:(string) Specifies whether the backup will be stored locally or remotely.* `Network Share` - The backup is stored remotely on a separate server.* `Local Storage` - The backup is stored locally on the endpoint. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `organization`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `password`:(string) Password of Backup server. 
* `path`:(string) The file system path where the backup images must be stored. Include the IP address/hostname of the network share location and the complete file system path. For example: 172.29.109.234/var/backups/. 
* `protocol`:(string) Protocol for transferring the backup image to the network share location.* `SCP` - Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) to access the file server.* `SFTP` - SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) to access file server.* `FTP` - File Transfer Protocol (FTP) to access file server. 
* `retention_count`:(int) Number of backup copies maintained on the local or remote server. When the created backup files exceed this number, the initial backup files are overwritten in a sequential manner. 
* `tags`:(Array)
