# Resource: intersight_iam._ldap_policy
LDAP Policy configurations.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `appliance_account`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a iamAccount resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `base_properties`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - Base settings of LDAP required while configuring LDAP policy. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `attribute`:(string) Role and locale information of the user. 
  + `base_dn`:(string) Base Distinguished Name (DN). Starting point from where server will search for users and groups.

If this option is selected and the LDAP server is configured for Anonymous logins, then the user gains access.* `ConfiguredCredentials` - Requires a known set of credentials to be specified for the initial bind process. If the initial bind process succeeds, then the distinguished name (DN) of the user name is queried and re-used for the re-binding process. If the re-binding process fails, then the user is denied access. 
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.

  + `nested_group_search_depth`:(int) Search depth to look for a nested LDAP group in an LDAP group map. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
  + `password`:(string) The password of the user for initial bind process. It can be any string that adheres to the following constraints. It can have character except spaces, tabs, line breaks. It cannot be more than 254 characters.
