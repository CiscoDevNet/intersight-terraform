# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_cluster_replication_network_policy
Specifies all replication network parameters for the cluster.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `cluster_profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to hyperflexClusterProfile resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `ip_pool_mo_reference`:(HashMap) - A reference to a moBaseMo resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `organization`:(HashMap) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `replication_bandwidth_mbps`:(int) Bandwidth for the Replication network in Mbps. 
* `replication_ipranges`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `end_addr`:(string) The end IPv4 address of the range. 
  + `gateway`:(string) The default gateway for the start and end IPv4 addresses. 
  + `netmask`:(string) The netmask specified in dot decimal notation.The start address, end address, and gateway must all be within the network specified by this netmask. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `start_addr`:(string) The start IPv4 address of the range. 
* `replication_mtu`:(int) MTU for the Replication network. 
* `replication_vlan`:(HashMap) - VLAN for the Replication network. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `name`:(string) The name of the VLAN.The name can be from 1 to 32 characters long and can contain a combination of alphanumeric characters, underscores, and hyphens. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
  + `vlan_id`:(int) The ID of the named VLAN. An ID of 0 means the traffic is untagged.The ID can be any number between 0 and 4095, inclusive. 
* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value.
