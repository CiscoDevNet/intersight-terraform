# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_node_profile
A configuration profile per node in the HyperFlex cluster.
It defines node settings such as IP address configuration for hypervisor management network, storage data network, HyperFlex management network, and the assigned physical server.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `assigned_server`:(HashMap) - A reference to a computeRackUnit resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `cluster_profile`:(HashMap) - A reference to a hyperflexClusterProfile resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1.

* `description`:(string) Description of the profile. 
* `hxdp_data_ip`:(string) IP address for storage data network (Controller VM interface). 
* `hxdp_mgmt_ip`:(string) IP address for HyperFlex management network. 
* `hypervisor_control_ip`:(string) IP address for hypervisor control such as VM migration or pod management. 
* `hypervisor_data_ip`:(string) IP address for storage data network (Hypervisor interface). 
* `hypervisor_mgmt_ip`:(string) IP address for Hypervisor management network. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete profile. 
* `src_template`:(HashMap) - A reference to a policyAbstractProfile resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource.

* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `type`:(string) Defines the type of the profile. Accepted value is instance.* `instance` - The profile defines the configuration for a specific instance of a target. 


## Import
`intersight_hyperflex_node_profile` can be imported using the Moid of the object, e.g.
