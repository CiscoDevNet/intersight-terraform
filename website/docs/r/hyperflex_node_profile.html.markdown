# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_node_profile
A configuration profile per node in the HyperFlex cluster.
It defines node settings such as IP address configuration for hypervisor management network, storage data network, HyperFlex management network, and the assigned physical server.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `assigned_server`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a computeRackUnit resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `cluster_profile`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a hyperflexClusterProfile resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `description`:(string) Description of the profile. 
* `hxdp_data_ip`:(string) IP address for storage data network (Controller VM interface). 
* `hxdp_mgmt_ip`:(string) IP address for HyperFlex management network. 
* `hypervisor_control_ip`:(string) IP address for hypervisor control such as VM migration or pod management. 
* `hypervisor_data_ip`:(string) IP address for storage data network (Hypervisor interface). 
* `hypervisor_mgmt_ip`:(string) IP address for Hypervisor management network. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete profile. 
* `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `src_template`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - A reference to a policyAbstractProfile resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `type`:(string) Defines the type of the profile. Accepted value is instance.* `instance` - The profile defines the configuration for a specific instance of a target.
