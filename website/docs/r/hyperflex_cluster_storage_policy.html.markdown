# Resource: intersight_hyperflex_cluster_storage_policy
A policy specifying HyperFlex cluster storage settings (optional).
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `cluster_profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to hyperflexClusterProfile resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy. 
* `disk_partition_cleanup`:(bool) If enabled, formats existing disk partitions (destroys all user data). 
* `logical_avalability_zone_config`:(HashMap) - Enable or disable Logical Availability Zones (LAZ). If enabled, HyperFlex Data Platform automatically selects and groups nodes into different availability zones. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions prior to 3.0 release, this setting does not apply. For HyperFlex Data Platform versions 3.0 or higher, this setting is only applicable to Fabric Interconnect attached HyperFlex systems with 8 or more converged nodes.

  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property. 
* `moid`:(string) The unique identifier of this Managed Object instance. 
* `name`:(string) Name of the concrete policy. 
* `organization`:(HashMap) - A reference to a organizationOrganization resource.When the $expand query parameter is specified, the referenced resource is returned inline.

* `tags`:(Array)
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `key`:(string) The string representation of a tag key. 
  + `value`:(string) The string representation of a tag value. 
* `vdi_optimization`:(bool) Enable or disable VDI optimization (hybrid HyperFlex systems only).
