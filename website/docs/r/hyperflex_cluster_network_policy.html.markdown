# Resource: intersight_hyperflex._cluster_network_policy
A policy specifying VLANs for management, VM migration, and VM traffic.
## Argument Reference
The following arguments are supported:
* `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
* `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
* `cluster_profiles`:(Array) An array of relationships to hyperflexClusterProfile resources. 
This complex property has following sub-properties:
  + `additional_properties`:
(Array with Maximum of one item) - Add additional properties in json format inside `jsonencode()` for this object.
  + `class_id`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.This property is used as a discriminator to identify the type of the payloadwhen marshaling and unmarshaling data. 
  + `moid`:(string)(Computed) The Moid of the referenced REST resource. 
  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the remote type referred by this relationship. 
  + `selector`:(string)(Computed) An OData $filter expression which describes the REST resource to be referenced. This field maybe set instead of 'moid' by clients.1. If 'moid' is set this field is ignored.1. If 'selector' is set and 'moid' is empty/absent from the request, Intersight determines the Moid of theresource matching the filter expression and populates it in the MoRef that is part of the objectinstance being inserted/updated to fulfill the REST request.An error is returned if the filter matches zero or more than one REST resource.An example filter string is: Serial eq '3AA8B7T11'. 
* `description`:(string) Description of the policy.

* `kvm_ip_range`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - The Out-of-band KVM IP range.Configures the service profiles to use IP addresses within this range for setting the KVM IP of a server.

  + `object_type`:(string) The fully-qualified name of the instantiated, concrete type.The value should be the same as the 'ClassId' property.The enum values provides the list of concrete types that can be instantiated from this abstract type. 
  + `start_addr`:(string) The start MAC address prefix of a MAC address prefix range in the form of 00:25:B5:XX. 
* `mgmt_vlan`:(Array with Maximum of one item) - The VLAN for the management network.
